									<h3>Morgan Stanley - Summer Technology Analyst (June-August 2020)</h3>
									<p>During my three months, I built a a novelty detector application that would <b>identify abnormal trade alerts</b> in thee Notify App (a system used by thousands of traders). I used a combination of the <b> LOF: local outlier factor</b> and <b>isolation forests</b> models to build a dectector that would identify abnormal hours or traders based on the number of alerts received. I also <b>built an interactive dashboard</b> that would update every hour and allow users to view descriptive statistics including the number of alerts types of alerts received.</p>

									<h3>Morgan Stanley - Summer Technology Analyst (June-August 2019)</h3>
									<p>Morgan Stanley generates hourly account position data was in a single line 1.5 GB sized file. This format of the file makes it rather time consuming to process, and it was imperative to reduce this time because often times, there would be swings in position values due the asset re-allocations or sometimes just system glitches. Because the file processing took so long, these swings could sometimes go unnoticed for several hours or days. Thus, during my three monnths, I <b>developed OIRS: Optimized Information Retrieval System</b> which processed these hourly files using <b>Apache Hadoop</b> and stored the position values in an easily query-able manner. Furthermore, I built a Position Swing Detector App that would allow users to easily <b>identify significant differences in account position values</b> by querying historical data stored. This system <b> reduced the time by ~ 5 hours </b> needed to identify abnormal swings in account position values. </p>

									<h3>John Deere Intelligent Solutions Group - Summer Intern (May 2018 - August 2018)</h3>
									<p>As an interrn, I developed a PWA (progressive web app) using React.js to start RDA (remote display access) sessions (a method to SSH into Deere machines) to allow farmers to easily update settings in Deere machines. This PWA allowed farmers to reduce the time spent logging into machines by ~ 1 hour. I was also a member of the app development teams where I added features to the teamâ€™s iOS and Android applications. These features allowed farmers to view details on field operations performed (e.g. viewing historical machine settings up to 3 months for certain field operations). </p>

									<h3>Capital One Illinois Digital Campus Lab - Intern (January 2018 - May 2018)</h3>
									<p>As a part-time intern, I worked on improving the recommendation engine on Menards' (client of Capital One) website. To improve recommendation, I used a variety of data mining techniques, namely market basket analysis. I designed an algorithm to find the best itemsets using a combination of the Apriori and Eclat algorithms. Approximately 70% of the website's users prefered the new recommendations to the previous.</p>
