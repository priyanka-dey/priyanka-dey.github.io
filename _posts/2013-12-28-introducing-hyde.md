Hi, I am a 3rd year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Southern California. I am very fortunate to be part of the HUMANs Lab, advised by Professors Emilio Ferrara and the LIME Lab, advised by Jieyu Zhao. Previously, I received my Master's in Computer Science from the University of Illinois: Urbana Champaign, where I was a member of the TiMAN lab, advised by Professor ChengXiang Zhai. I also received my Bachelor's in Statistics and Computer Science from the University of Illinois: Urbana Champaign.

### Research Interests

I am broadly interested in making large language models more culturally aware and aligned with humans. My research focuses on understanding how LLMs can adapt to different cultural norms, values, and preferences without falling into stereotypes. I am also exploring how models can be personalized to align with user's traits, values, and goals. A key part of my work is developing methods to evaluate human and cultural alignment, including new benchmarks that combine psychological traits, cultural differences, and interaction data.
