Hi, I am a 3rd year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Southern California. I am very fortunate to be advised by Professors Emilio Ferrara and Jieyu Zhao. Previously, I was a Computer Science Master's and Computer Science and Statistics Bachelor's student at the University of Illinois: Urbana Champaign.

### Research Interests

I am broadly interested in making large language models more culturally aware and aligned with humans. My research focuses on understanding how LLMs can adapt to different cultural norms, values, and preferences without falling into stereotypes. I am also exploring how models can be personalized to align with user's traits, values, and goals. A key part of my work is developing methods to evaluate human and cultural alignment, including new benchmarks that combine psychological traits, cultural differences, and interaction data.


Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Hyde features

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/hyde#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the `<a href="https://github.com/poole/hyde">`GitHub repository`</a>` for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
