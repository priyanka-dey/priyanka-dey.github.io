									<h3>TIMAN Group (Advised by: Professor ChengXiang Zhai)</h3>
									<h5><i>August 2019 - Present</i></h5>
									<p>As a member of TIMAN, I was able to work on a multitude of projects focused on studying opioid usage in the US. One of my first ventures included collaborating with Alex Morales, PhD, and UIUC’s HSMG (Health, Social Media, and Technology Group) led by Professor Dolores Albarracín to improve a classifier used to identify actionable messages about opioid use using social media. I designed a novel feature generated from Twitter messages discussing opioid usage by using tweet grammar trees and dependency parse trees to help improve classification models. My efforts on this assignment further inspired me to study how drug usage is discussed and perceived in the US on social media. Thus, for my undergraduate thesis, I developed a ML model with novel features generated from tweeters’ tones and tweet vocabulary to identify significant contexts and topics. The model also works to identify various opinions about drug usage expressed in messages.</p>

									<h3>Project Junto (Advised by: Professors Mariana Silva & Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider)</h3>
									<h5><i>August 2019 - Present</i></h5>
									<p>Project Junto is an open-source tool that seeks to provide course instructors with an easy means of forming project groups in collaboration-based courses based on a bidding system and a genetic algorithm. As part of this project, I worked on developing the NodeJS application as well as the middleware for storing project data, student bids, and instructor constraints. For more information on this tool, please visit this <a href="https://peer.asee.org/introducing-junto-a-web-tool-to-build-project-teams-based-on-a-bidding-strategy"> link </a>.  </p>
