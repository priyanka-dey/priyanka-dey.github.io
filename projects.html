									<h3>ATS (Automated Trading System)</h3>
									<p>Identifying stocks to trade can be a stressful and difficult to follow task. This application built using Python and Flask allows users to identify stocks that have performed significantly well over a long period of time. The algorithm behind this application was built using cross-correlation to identify similarities between stock trends. </p>
                                    <h3>Breakout Rendition</h3>
                                    <p>I have developed a C++ rendition of the popular game using Box2D, a physics engine to mimic gravity and other forces affecting the ball's trajectory.</p>
                                    <h3>G-Tab (Grocery Tablet)</h3>
                                    <p>Grocery shopping for the best produce but at the cheapest price can be a big hassle for busy individuals. The G-Tab is a device that allows users to customize the tablet to order their necessary groceries from their favorite groceries at the cheapest price with the push of just a few buttons. This device was built using a Raspberry to allow for customization of objects to order and a special 'Sale' button. This button allows users to find the cheapest good within a 10 mile radius. Customized grocery items, vendors, and prices were web-scraped using Python and stored in a Mongo database. Upon ordering groceries, these items would be fetched to provide users with the best total possible. </p>
                                    <h3>Naive Bayes Image Classifier</h3>
                                    <p>I developed a C++ number image classifier using the MNIST dataset using Bayes probability models. The model achieved an overall 90% average over all the classes.</p>
                                    <h3>Nim Game Simulation</h3>
                                    <p>I developed a Java rendition of the mathematical game, Nim (based on xor sums) in both normal and mis√®re plays.</p>
                                    <h3>TiMed</h3>
                                    <p>Administering patient drugs (specifically pill) to users in a timely manner and in proper dosage can be time-consuming and labor-taxing. Thus, I collaborated on a system that could provide patients with their medicine using a novel clasp pipe method which would deliver the drug at pre-programmed intervals. The tool was built using Python and an Arduino.</p>
